3. we can access object properties in JS with dot or bracket notation


4. Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit as soon as they have a result 


5. Declarative Programming writes code that describes what you want, but not necessarily how to get it. 


6. Create a function to return true if a given string params includes the word “pinecone”, you can use the .includes builtin string function. Create an array that contains few 
sentences at different indexes and include pinecone in at least one of them. Use the filter function to create a new array using the function you created.

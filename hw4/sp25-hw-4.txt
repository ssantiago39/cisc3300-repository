Homework 4 
1. How does an interpreted programming language differ from a compiled language? 
* In certain programming languages the source code is interpreted by a different program, called the interpreter, which reads and executes the code rather than the machine doing it. This is called an interpreter language. In a compiled language, the machine translates the source code before it is executed
2. Contrast dynamically typed programming languages with statically typed ones. And contrast strongly typed programming languages with weakly typed ones. 
* In static typed programs the types of data are bound to the variable and types are checked at compile time, while in dynamic they are checked at runtime. Dynamic typing is where type checking  is performed at runtime, which allows the type of a variable to change over its lifetime. Weakly typed programs on the other hand (than dynamically typed) recognize different data types but don't use them strictly, instead the try to convert data when reasonable
3. What is the difference between var, let, and const when declaring variables in JS? 
* Using var is global+function scoped and redeclarable
* Using let is block scoped and redeclarable
* And using const is block scoped and not redeclarable
4. What are anonymous functions? Higher order functions? Callback functions? First class functions? 
* An anonymous function is a function without a name, high-order functions return a function or take other functions as arguments, a callback function is passed as an argument to another function to be called later, and first-class functions are functions in that language that are treated like other variables
5. Define objects in JavaScript. 
* Objects in JavaScript are a non-primitive datatype, and is a collection of properties. These properties have a name(key) and a value. In the case that a properties value is a function, the property would be known as a method. To classify them, objects are key-value pairs.
6. Loop through the cats array variable found here: 
https://github.com/cisc3300/SP25-lecture-code/blob/main/2-13-lecture/cats.js a. if the cats adoption status is available add that cat’s name to a result array b. create a new sentence about your newly adopted cats from your result array via the join array function. 
7. Create a variable that sets a value via a ternary operator. Use Math.random() * 10, which will output a random number from 1 to 10, to set the variable’s value as a string of “greater than five!” if the output from Math.random() * 10 is greater than 5, and “less than five!” if the output is less than 5. 
8. Loop through the values of the cat object variable found here: 
https://github.com/cisc3300/SP25-lecture-code/blob/main/2-13-lecture/cats.js. Console.log the value of each property in the loop. 
9. Write two if statements, pick the correct comparison operator to have the first if statement equate an integer of 1 and a string of ‘1’ as true. And pick the correct comparison operator to have the second equate an integer of 1 and a string of ‘1’ as false. 
10. Using the map function create a new array via the cats array used in question 6. Pass the map function a callback function that accepts each element of the array as a parameter. Return the value of the name property of each object in the cats array concatenated with the string “ is cute!”. The output should be an array of “Charlie is cute!”, “Lily is cute!”, etc. 
Include questions 6-10 in a single JavaScript file or HTML file via a script tag.
